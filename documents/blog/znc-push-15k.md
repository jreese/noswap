One of my favorite projects that I've created has to be [ZNC Push][], the plugin
for [ZNC][] that generates push notifications for IRC highlights and private
messages.  It supports a wide array of push services for all of the major mobile
platforms, and gives the user deep flexibility in choosing how and when to
trigger these notifications.

However, this means I have very little insight into usage statistics of the
plugin.  [Pushover][] is the only service that gives me usage data across all
users, but considering Push supports six other networks as well as custom push
URLs, this only represents an unknown portion of the total usage.  But I will
continue to draw baseless conclusions from it regardless. :)

So without further ado, the pretty graphs straight from the Pushover dashboard:
