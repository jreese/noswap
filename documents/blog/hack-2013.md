Almost exactly a year ago, I started my first week as an engineer at Facebook,
greeted by a sign on my new desk with in bold, red lettering:

> What would you do if you weren't afraid?

It has been an exciting, interesting, stressful, and sometimes even terrifying
experience, doing things I never thought I was capable of, and learning from
some of the best engineers in the industry.  From my previous jobs working with
servers countable on one hand, to working with literally thousands of servers
storing an unimaginable amount of photos, videos, and more.
